1) What is Python?
A) Python is the High-Level programming language which is used for creating the Software's like Mobile Applications, Web-Development, Desktop Applications and more.

2) Programming for print function.
A) Code:-
		" print("Our-Required code") "
	
3) What is Variable?
A) Variable are the thing which will help us to store the temporary data in Computer's memory.

4) Example of Variable?
A)	
	Code:-
	----			
			" price = 10
			  print(price)

			  Output:-
			  ______

				10  ""
		
				(Or)

			" price = 10 
			  print(price + 23)

			  Output:-
			  ______

				23 ""

				(Or)

			"  price = 10	--->		NOTE:-	PYTHON INTERPRETER WILL GET EXCECUTED FROM TOP TO BOTTOM
			   price = 20
			   print(price)

			   Output:-
			   ______

				 20  ""

5) Data types in Python?
A) There are mainly 4 types of data types and they are listed below
	
   Datatypes:-
	
	1) int = Integer
	2) float = floating number
	3) str = string 
	4) True or False = boolean function
   
   Example's:-

	1) price = 10 (Number datatype (Or) Integer datatype)
	2) name = "Crypto" (Character datatype)
	3) grade = 7.9 (Floating number or Floating datatype)
	4) is_real = False (Or) True (Boolean Value)

6) What is datatype conversion in Python and how it will be help to us?
A) Datatype conversion is the one of the important topic in programming language called "Python". Because it will help us to convert out datatypes from (int to str) or (str to int)

	Datatype conversion:-

		1) int()
		2) float()
		3) bool()
		4) str()
	
	For example code for datatype conversion:-

		"""	
			birth_year = input("""
				What is your BirthYear:- """)
			age = 2023 - birth_year
			print(age)	"""

7) What is print(type(value))?
A) It is a simple function or a command in python to know the datatype of the value.

8) Write a code for converting a person age from lbs to kgs?
A) Code:-
	
	"""
		weight_lbs = input("Weight_lbs:- ")
		weight_kgs = int(weight_lbs) * 0.45
		print(weight_kgs)	"""

9) What is the formatted strings?
A) Formatted strings are used for simplifying our code with letter called "f".

	Example Code:-

		""	first = "Crypto"
			last = "Dhana Sri"
			msg = f"{first}, [{last}] is a coder"

		Output:- Crypto, Dhana Sri is a coder	""

10) Definition of string method's in Python?
A)  Sting Method's are the function's which let us to perform specific task as per our requirements.

		1) And :- Both statements should be True.
		2) Or  :- Atleast one statement should be True.
		3) Not :- It will inverse the value.
		
12) What are comparision operator's?
A)  Comparision operator's are used for comparing the values in the given information or anything like degree's.

	Comparision Operator's:-
		
		1) < :- Less Than Operator
		2) > :- Greater Than Operator
		3) == :- Equal Than Operator
		4) <= :- Less than or Equalthan Operator
		5) >- :- Greater than or Equalthan Operator
		6) != :- Not equal than operator

13) Project-Weight_Convertor.
A)  Code for Weight_Convertor:-

		""	weight = int(input("Weight:- "))
			unit = input("(L)bs or (k) gs")
		
			if unit == "L":
				
14) What is PEP?
A)  PEP means "Python Enhancement Proposal".

15) What is pypi?
